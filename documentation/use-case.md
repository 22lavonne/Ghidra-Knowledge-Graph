Build the Use-case

    1. Fill the Narrative section with a top-level description of your use-case, including references. As a guideline, this section should be about 500 words. This should, at a minimum, answer the questions:
        Who are you supporting?
        What are their goals?
        Why is making a Knowledge Graph interesting -- or important -- for the use-case?
        Why a knowledge graph and not a relational (tabular) database?
    2. Fill the Competency Questions section with no fewer than 10 competency questions. Thoroughly describe your intended interactions and what data will be retrieved to support said interactions.
    3. Fill the Potential Datasets section with links and access dates for no less than five potential datasets.
    Fill the Existing Resources section with any resources (e.g., ontologies, knowledge graphs, or standards) which can be used 4. in the project.
    5. Provide all references in the References section. References should be numbered starting at 1, listed in order of appearance, and otherwise following the IEEE reference style. Ensure that the DOI is included for every reference, where available.
