<!-- 
Identify a thorough list of key notions.

    For each key notion, explain the rationale of why it is a key notion.
    For each key notion or set of key notions, identify a pattern which can be used to model them, otherwise indicate that there is no existing pattern.
        Draft an instantiation of the pattern (a module) based on the use-case, where possible.
        For key notions with no pattern, draft a module which would model them.
    Connect the key notion to where the data is coming from. For example, if an Event is a key notion, which piece of the identified datasets are used to populate the module.
        Occasionally there will be controlled vocabularies. These are not technically patterns, but are a list of individuals that are important (and will not change). Indicate which key notions behave as such and their list of individuals.
